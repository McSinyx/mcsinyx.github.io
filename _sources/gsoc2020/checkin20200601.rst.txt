First Check-In
==============

Hi everyone, I am McSinyx, a Vietnamese undergraduate student
who loves `free software`_.  This summer I am working with
the maintainers and the contributors of ``pip`` to make
the package manager :pip:`download in parallel <825>`.

What did I do during the community bonding period?
--------------------------------------------------

Aside from bonding with ``pip``'s maintainers and contributors as well as
with my mentors, I was also experimenting on the theoretical and technical
obstacles blocking this GSoC project.  Pradyun Gedam (a mentor of mine)
suggested making `a proof of concept`_ to determine if parallel downloading
can play nicely with ResolveLib_'s abstraction and we are reviewing it
together.  On the technical side, we ``pip``'s committers are exploring
:pip:`available options for parallelization <8169>` and I made an attempt to
:pip:`make use of Python's standard worker pool in a portable way <8320>`.

Did I get stuck anywhere?
-------------------------

Yes, of course!  Neither of the experiments above is finished as of
this moment.  Though, I am optimistic that the issues will not be
real blockers and we will figure that out in the next few days.

What is coming up next?
-----------------------

As planned, this week I am going to refactor the package downloading code
in ``pip``.  The main purpose is to decouple the networking code from
the package preparation operation and make sure that it is thread-safe.

In addition, I am also continuing mentioned experiments to have a better
confidence on the future of this GSoC project.

To other GSoC students, mentors and admins reading this, I am wishing
you all good health and successful projects this summer!
