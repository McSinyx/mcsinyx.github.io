Final Check-In
==============

Hello there!

What did I do last week?
------------------------

Not much, but seemingly implementation-wise I have finished my GSoC project:

* Finish the implementation of wheels' parallel download (:pip:`8771`)
* Help make ``pip``'s CI green again (:pip:`8790`)
* Reformat a few spots in user guide (:pip:`8795`)

Did I get stuck anywhere?
-------------------------

I got sick, but I am recovering now!

What is coming up next?
-----------------------

I will try to spend the time I got left within the scope of GSoC
to :pip:`improve cache usage of the fast-deps feature <8720>`.
