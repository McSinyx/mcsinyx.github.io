# Continuous Documentation: Hosting Read the Docs on GitHub Pages

This repo is a fork-ready base for your project's documentation. It lets you host a sphinx-generated site (with the Read the Docs theme) on GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

# How to use this repo

1. Fork this repo
1. On your forked repo, go to the "Actions" tab and click "I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them" to enable GitHub workflows
1. On your forked repo, go to the "Settings" tab. Under "GitHub Pages" choose 'gh-pages branch' under "Source"
1. Edit the files in [src/](/src/) and [docs/](/docs) as needed

Every time you push to github.com on master, github will automatically spin up a container in their cloud to update your documentation.
