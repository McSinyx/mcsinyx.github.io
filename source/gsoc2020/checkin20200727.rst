Fifth Check-In
==============

Hello and I hope y'all are still doing well!

What did I do last week?
------------------------

I was not really productive last weekâ€”most of the following tickets are fillers
to make use of the spare cycles I had when I was still trying to figure out
the way to implement the main work.

* Finalize the ``--use-feature=fast-deps`` flag (:pip:`8588`)
* Improve mocking of environment variables in the test suit (:pip:`8614`)
* Finalize the fix for verbose/quiet options specified via
  configuration files and environment variables (:pip:`8578`)
* Clean up a tiny bit in the resolver internal API (:pip:`8629`)
* Start working on seperating the download of wheels
  from dependency resolution (:pip:`8638`)

Did I get stuck anywhere?
-------------------------

I'm struggling on refactoring the code to support separate download.
``pip``'s codebase was not intended for this and thus there are
many execution paths and other details entangled around the relevant area.

What is coming up next?
-----------------------

``pip`` 20.2 is going to be released within the next few days with
``--use-feature=fast-deps`` included and I'm mentally prepare to fix
any undiscovered problem.  At the same time, I will continue working
on :pip:`8638` and hopefully get it done soon enough to begin drafting
download parallelization strategies, mostly with the UI.
