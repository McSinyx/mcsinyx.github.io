Fourth Check-In
===============

Hello there! I'm having my second year's last exam tomorrow,
but it `feels like summer`_ already!  I've been finalizing quite a few things
to get them ready for pip 20.2b2.

What did I do last week?
------------------------

I've spent most of the time on getting :pip:`the opt-in <8532>` for obtaining
dependency information via lazy wheels ready.  It will be available as
``--use-feature=fast-deps`` and only has effect when
``--use-feature=2020-resolver`` also presents.

While waiting for reviews and suggestions, I made some patches for
internal cleansing, namely :pip:`8568`, :pip:`8571` and :pip:`8578`.
Some of the similar patches I made earlier were also merged last week:
:pip:`8456` and :pip:`8538`.

Did I get stuck anywhere?
-------------------------

Not really, everything was going as expected for me.

What is coming up next?
-----------------------

After :pip:`8532`, I'll work on the parallel download of the postponed wheels.
My main current concern is with how the download progress will be reported
to the users, but I think I'll figure it out soon.
