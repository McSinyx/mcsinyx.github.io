Sixth Check-In
==============

Hello there!

What did I do last week?
------------------------

It has been a quite fun week for me, given the current state of
development and the newly dicovered bugs thanks to pip 20.2 release:

* Initiate discussion with the maintainers of pip on isolating
  networking code for late download in parallel (:pip:`8697`)
* Discuss the UI of parallel download (:pip:`8698`)
* Log debug information relating lazy wheel decision (:pip:`8710`)
* Disable caching for range requests (:pip:`8716`)
* Dedent late download logs (:pip:`8722`)
* Add a hook for batch downloading (third attempt I think) (:pip:`8737`)
* Test hash checking for fast-deps (:pip:`8743`)

Did I get stuck anywhere?
-------------------------

Not exactly, everything is going smoothly and I'm feeling awesome!

What is coming up next?
-----------------------

I'll try to solve :pip:`8697` and :pip:`8698` within the next few days.
I am optimistic that the parallel download prototype will be done
within this week.
