Third Check-In
==============

Holla, holla, holla!  Last seven days has not been a really productive week
for me, though I think there are still some nice things to share with
you all here!  The good news is that I've finish my last le√ßon as a somophore,
the bad news is that I have a bunch of upcoming tests, mainly in the form
of group projects and/or presentation (phew!).  Enough about me,
let's get back to ``pip``:

What did I do last week?
------------------------

Not much, actually )-:

* Write some tests for :pip:`the HTTP range mapping for wheel <8467>`.
* :pip:`Try to bring back <8504>` multithreaded ``pip list --outdated``
  and ``--uptodate``, as :pip:`the parallel <8320>` ``map`` was merged
  earlier today.
* Nitpick :pip:`8332`
  (yep it's a new low for me to include this to the list (-:).

Did I get stuck anywhere?
-------------------------

Not exactly, since I didn't do much d-;  `Many of my PRs`_ are stalling though.
On one hand the maintainers of ``pip`` are all volunteers working in
their free time, on the other hand I don't think I have tried hard enough
to get their attention on my PRs.

What is coming up next?
-----------------------

I'll try my best getting the following merged upstream before
:pip:`the upcoming beta release <8206>`:

* Parallel networking for ``pip list``: :pip:`8504`
* Lazy wheel for dependency information: :pip:`8467`, :pip:`8411`
  (to determine if hashing is required) and :pip:`a new patch introducing this
  as an unstable feature <8467#issuecomment-648717032>`
